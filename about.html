			<h2> About Us </h2>
			<p>COMPLEX Auto is an online, family business founded in 1999 by automotive engineers with two goals:</p>
			<li>Liberate information hidden behind the auto parts store counter</li>
			<li> Make auto parts affordable (by remaining a strictly online company, we have no store locations, no counter-people 
				 and don't have a lot of money tied up in slow-moving inventory.<br> 
				 We pass on those savings with lower prices so cars of all ages can be reliable and fun to drive.)
			</li> 
			<p>Today, we ship thousands of parts, from hundreds of manufacturers, to millions of customers all over 
			   the world. And the COMPLEX Auto catalog keeps expanding. 
				Someday, it may <br> be possible to build an entire car using parts from COMPLEX Auto!
			</p>
			<h2> Privacy Policy </h2>
			<p>We store customer names, addresses, email addresses and phone numbers so we can find your order if you  
			   ask us about it, so we can tell you when your order ships, 
				and so you <br> can use the "Remember Me" feature instead of typing your address on every order. We do 
				not store credit card numbers.
			</p>
			<p>We do not telemarket. We do not sell, rent or share customer information. We may use your email address 
			   to tell you about discounts, promotions, newsletters or other events. <br> Each email offers the option to 
			   unsubscribe from our mailing list with one click.
