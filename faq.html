				<button class="accordion">Buying the Right Part</button>
				<div class="accordion-content">
					   <p>At COMPLEX Auto, we are concerned about your safety and want to prevent damage to your vehicle. 
						With today's vehicles, purchasing and installing auto parts can be a complicated process. We understand this. 
						That is why we have Professional Parts People.
						While we always do our best to ensure we provide you with accurate and up-to-date part information, 
						human and/or software errors sometimes occur. 
						These errors may cause an incorrect part to be displayed as the result of a part search.
						</p>
						<p>For these reasons and more, you must always do, at a minimum, the following 3 steps to help ensure 
						that the part you buy is the correct one for your repair project.
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Make sure ALL of the vehicle information you provide is correct. This includes the vehicles you 
							define and any questions that you may answer on our web site. 
							Read and understand ALL of the informational checkmarks listed with each part. If there are codes or 
							statements that do not match your vehicle, do not buy the part. 
							If there is information you do not understand, contact us at our Parts Help number.
							</li>
							<li>Compare Web site photos with your old part. If photos of the item you are purchasing are available on our Web site 
							and if they are not labeled as "representative" photos, compare them with the old part and make sure they match.</li>
							<li>When the part arrives compare it with the old part. If for any reason it does not appear to be the correct part, 
							contact us to confirm that it is the correct part before installing it</li>
						</ol>
						<p>Using these steps will assist you in selecting the correct part to get the job done right. 
						Remember that, as with any large, powerful and complex system, failure to select the right part 
						for your vehicle may result in damage to your vehicle, 
						serious injury or death. Do not risk it. If in doubt, get answers from support staff.

				<button class="accordion">What is a core charge?</button>
				<div class="accordion-content">
					<p>Some products have a core charge associated with them. A core is some portion of 
					a part that can be recycled or reused by the manufacturer. 
					Doing this saves the manufacturer money and helps our environment.

				<button class="accordion">Installation Instructions</button>
				<div class="accordion-content">
					<p>Because of the variety and complexity of vehicles available today, we are unable to provide 
					detailed installation instructions for your part. 
					We do have vehicle repair manuals available for purchase and online services to assist you. 
					Additionally, our manufacturers sometimes provide limited instructions with the parts we sell. 
					We highly recommend that you take advantage of these resources when working on your vehicle. 
					If you are ever unsure of the correct or safest way to install a part, we recommend you seek help 
					from a licensed, professional installer.
					</p>

					<p>Failure to install a part correctly may result in damage to your vehicle, serious injury or death. 
					Do not risk it. If you do not know how to install a part, get answers from a licensed, professional 
					installer or have them install the part for you.
